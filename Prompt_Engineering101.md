<h1>Prompt Engineering</h1>

**Prompt Engineering** is the practice of designing inputs for generative AI tools that will produce optimal outputs. Designing the proper prompt for a Large Language Model (LLM) will allow it to better service you. As a Cybersecurity enthusiast, I am also interested in Prompt Injection Attacks to try and get LLM's to produce improper results.

<h1>Input/Context</h1>

Take a look at the two prompts below asking ChatGPT to explain write a 30-word poem for an audience of people. The first prompt simply asks ChatGPT to write a poem for an audience. There is no context for ChatGPT to work with. ChatGPT might be able to write a better poem if it had context, like who the audience is that the poem is being read to. 

In the second prompt, I once again ask ChatGPT to write a 30 word poem for an audience, but this time I provide much more context. For example, I tell ChatGPT that the audience is full of people that work in the dining industry, so now our poem is related to food and dining. I even provide ChatGPT with a persona when I tell it "You are a famous food blogger." If I had to present a poem in front of all my friends in the food and dining industry, I would rather recite the poem in the second picture. This is why it's important to provide a large language model with the **context** it needs to better service you.
